AbrahamAI is a small, independent project created to help people explore the life, faith, and historical setting of the Biblical patriarch Abraham — using only Scripture as the final authority, and archaeology/history as supporting context.

It is powered by BDH (Baby Dragon Hatchling), an in-house, transparent generative AI model family developed by iBeanSoftware — showing that good AI can be built locally, respectfully, and for the glory of God.

No ads. No subscriptions. No tracking. Just knowledge shared freely.
